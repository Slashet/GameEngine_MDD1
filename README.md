# GameEngine_MDD1
MDD1 is a beginner-friendly 2D game engine developed in C++ using the SDL framework, specifically designed for younger users. It provides a simplified interface that allows children to create their own games while learning the core concepts of game development.

Key features include:

Sprite management: Easily import, place, and animate 2D sprites.

Event handling system: Intuitive input and interaction system for responding to keyboard and mouse events.

Character and object creation: Simple tools to define in-game entities and their behaviors.

Scene editor: A visual scene-building environment where users can arrange objects and define game logic without complex coding.

The engine aims to lower the entry barrier for young, aspiring game developers by abstracting away low-level technical details and focusing on creativity, interaction, and experimentation.
